                    MacBook Pro has the longest battery life ever in a Mac — up to <br>
                    22 hours. That efficiency is the magic of Apple silicon. And all models <br>
                    remain just as fast whether plugged in or not. So wherever inspiration <br>
                    strikes or whenever duty calls, run with it.
